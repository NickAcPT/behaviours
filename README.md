# behaviours

Repository with many generic behaviours I wish were implemented by others before

## Implemented behaviours

### Canvas

This canvas behaviour is a very simple generic library to handle draggable and selectable elements on a canvas.

The elements themselves are abstracted and any object can be used for them - as long as you provide an implementation to
that abstraction.

The only thing canvas renders are lines and rectangles.

### Replay

This replay behaviour is a recreation of the replay system deployed by the Hypixel Network.

It is a very simple system that allows you to record and replay actions in a game. It is very generic and can be used
for any game - as long as you provide an implementation to the abstraction.
