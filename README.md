Repository with many generic behaviours I wish were implemented by others before


## Implemented behaviours

### Canvas

This canvas behaviour is a very simple generic library to handle draggable and selectable elements on a canvas.

The elements themselves are abstracted and any object can be used for them - as long as you provide an implementation to that abstraction.

The only thing canvas renders are lines and rectangles.
